### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a brazilian CS student at USP (Campus of SÃ£o Carlos). Learned to program writing games in HTML5, and while I still like doing that from time to time, now I am a [competitive programmer](https://codeforces.com/profile/lucasturci) who likes to do personal projects once in a while, mostly in C++, Javascript, Typescript and Go. **Check out some here!**
